Making digital musical instruments has been a part of my journey to find a new fragile musical space from within digital technology. I see a musical instrument as a portal into a sonic world and a faithful friend through hours, days and years of musical exploration. It is both a guiding voice and a humble servant. It builds community beyond language and provides a space for still meditation.
