One of the very first times I held the instrument, my fingers spontaneously started playing this
  traditional song from Åland. It's a sailor song about leaving your loved one on shore. I imagine a group of sailors singing this in 1909, when it was first
  published in its current form, rocking away with their ship.

  This first incarnation of the Neod's sound synthesis is raw and quite brutal, just a triangle wave
  with an ASR envelope. But just like the sailor in the song the instrument still has some
  attractive vulnerabilities. When playing it with the note being constantly on, like a bagpipe, the
  imperfections from me not moving all my fingers at exactly the same time are entirely exposed,
  giving the sound a distinctly digital and distinctly human character. They affect different
  pitches differently since they require different finger movements and involve buttons with
  varyingly large interval sizes.

  In my arrangement of _Vem kan segla förutan vind?_ I embraced the imperfections of my playing as
  part of the instrument's expressivity and mimicked the vastness of the sea with 30 layers of
  recordings at different distances from the listener. The melody is fractured into segments that
  fully come together only once in a canon-like multi part arrangement. I like to imagine it as 4
  drunk sailors with very good ears singing their hearts out on a rocking ship.

  The neod excells at microtonal variations. In this arrangement they occur mostly as ornaments, but
  there is one middle third leading from the minor third of the main motif onto the theme starting
  on the major third relative to the drone.
  
  Next up for the neod is more complex timbral variations and amplitude control.
